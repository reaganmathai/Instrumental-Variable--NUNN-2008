Long-Term Effects of Africa’s Slave Trades
# Instrumental-Variable--NUNN-2008

Overview
This repository contains a dataset and a research paper titled "The Long-Term Effects of Africa’s Slave Trades" by Nathan Nunn, published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in February 2008. The study investigates whether part of Africa's current underdevelopment can be attributed to its slave trades. By utilizing data from shipping records and historical documents reporting slave ethnicities, Nathan Nunn constructs estimates of the number of slaves exported from each country during Africa's slave trades and finds a robust negative relationship between the number of slaves exported from a country and its current economic performance.

Dataset
The dataset, slave_trade_QJE.dta, contains the constructed estimates of the number of slaves exported from each African country during the slave trades along with various economic performance indicators of these countries in the modern era.

Columns
Country: Name of the African country.
Slaves_Exported: Estimated number of slaves exported from the country during the slave trades.
Economic_Performance: Various indicators of economic performance in the modern era, such as GDP per capita, literacy rates, etc. (The specific indicators included will need to be detailed based on the actual dataset content).

Usage
This dataset can be used to analyze the impact of Africa's slave trades on its current economic development. Researchers can use statistical software such as Stata to explore the relationship between historical slave exports and various modern economic indicators.

Research Paper
The PDF document, NUNN (QJE, 2008).pdf, provides a detailed account of the methodology, findings, and implications of the research. It is essential reading for anyone looking to understand the dataset's context or explore further the long-term effects of the slave trades on African countries.

Key Findings
There is a significant negative relationship between the historical slave exports and current economic performance across African countries.
The impact of the slave trades on economic development is found to be causal, with instrumental variables analysis suggesting that increased extraction during the slave trades caused worse subsequent economic performance.
